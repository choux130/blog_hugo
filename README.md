This personal website is mainly created by [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) with a Hugo theme [harbor](https://github.com/matsuyoshi30/harbor). 

Here are things I added or changes on the template to meet my needs.
1. Enable [KaTex](https://katex.org/) by following this [harbor tutorial](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/harbor/2019/03/08/math-typesetting/). 
2. Instead of using Disqus, I chose [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) as my comment tool which sync comments to github issues. 
    * [Goodbye, Disqus! Hello, Utterances!](https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/)
